# 🔥 Utility Churn Prediction Framework (UK Market – EDFE)

🚀 I just built a full-stack ML pipeline for customer churn prediction in the UK utilities sector — targeting real business scenarios like EDF Energy!

This project delivers a robust machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn in the UK utilities domain (EDF Energy supplier). 
Designed for business-critical use cases, it includes preprocessing, outlier detection, multi-model evaluation, and stakeholder-ready diagnostics.

## 📦 Features
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis with visual outputs
- 🔍 Outlier removal with dynamic IQR-based filtering
- 🧮 Categorical encoding and feature scaling
- 🤖 Model comparison across 12+ classifiers
- 📈 Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- 💬 Interpretability ready (SHAP compatible)
- 🗃️ Dataset: `utility_churn_dataset.csv` (40,000 rows)


✅ 40,000 customer records
✅ 13+ predictive features + added behavioral depth
